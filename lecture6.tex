\section{Lower Bound on the Number of Shared Memory Location}
\begin{theorem}
(Burns and Lynch)Any mutex algorithem that uses only RW on n processes require at least n shared locations.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Consider 2 processes, say P and Q, in competing for Critical Section. They have only one shared memory location A. 
Let Q run till it's about to write to A. 
Let P run and enter critical section.
Let Q run again. It enters CS.
Mutex violation.
Consider 3 processes, say P, Q and R. They have 2 shared memory locations A and B.
Let P and Q run till they are about to write to A.
Let R run and enter critical section.
let P and Q run again. One of them will enter critcal section.
Mutex violation.
With this method we can extend the situation to n processors and prove the theorem.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
Covering state. All share variables are about to be overwritten by processes and the shared stats is consistant with no process in CS.
\end{definition}
\section{Fischer's Algorithem}

Turn = -1 Means the door is open.\newline
\textbf{RequestCS:}
\begin{lstlisting}
while(ture) {
  while(turn != -1);
  turn = i;
  wait_for_delta_time_units();
  if(turn == i) return;
}
\end{lstlisting}
\textbf{ReleaseCS:}
\begin{lstlisting}
turn = -1
\end{lstlisting}

This algorithm can cause mutex violation. One senario:\newline
P_i$ reads turn = -1$\newline
P_j$ reads turn = -1$\newline
P_j$ sets turn = j$\newline
P_j$ reads turn = j$ and enter CS\newline
P_i$ sets turn = i$\newline
P_i$ reads turn = i and enter CS$\newline

\begin{theorem}
Assuming $delta >= C$, Fischer's Algorithm satisfies mutex. C: maximum time required to close the door, ie. set the turn.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let P_i$ be the processor that enters CS successfully. Assume there is another processor $P_j$ that may enter CS.$\newline
  \includegraphics{proof0}\newline
P_j$ must writes turn after $P_i$ reads it to be -1. If it writes before $P_i$ writes turn, after waiting for delta units of time which is longer than C, then $P_i$ must have already finished writing turn, $P_j$ will defnitely read turn = i then it will not enter CS. If $P_j$ writes turn after $P_i$ writes turn, then $P_i$ will read turn = j after waiting delta units of time, then it will not enter CS. Proved that only one processor will enter CS$
\end{proof}

\section{Lamport's Fast Algorithm}
This algorithm enables for processors to enter CS fast when there is no contention. \newline
No contention -- fast path
Contention -- slow path
\subsection{Splitter}
\includegraphics{splitter}
\begin{lstlisting}
For every P_i:
  Variables: 
    door: {open, closed}, initially open；
    last: pid, initially -1；
  last = i;
  if (door == closed) return left;
  else {
    door = closed;
    if (last == i) return down;
    else return right;
  }
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{claim}
  $|left| <= n-1$
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
  Someone need to close the door
\end{proof}
\begin{claim}
  $|right|<=n-1$
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
  Consider processor P_i$ such that last = i then $P_i$ is part of left or down. So as at least one process would not go right.$
\end{proof}
\begin{claim}
  $|down| <= 1$
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
  Let P_i$ be the first process to go down. Assume there is another processor $P_j$ that may go down.$\newline
  \includegraphics{proof.png}\newline
  $As shown in the picture, if $P_j$ does everything bofore $P_i$ writes last, then $P_j$ would be the first one to go down, which conflicts with our assumption. However, $P_j$ must writes to last before $P_i$ does otherwise $P_i$ would not be able to read last = i at the end. $P_j$ must closes the door after $P_i$ checks the door, otherwise $P_i$ would have found the door closed, then it cannot go down. Then we have $P_i$ writes to last before $P_i$ checks the door, before $P_j$ closes the door, before $P_j$ reads last. It means $P_j$ must reads last = i then it can not go down.$
\end{proof}
